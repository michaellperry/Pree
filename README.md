## Keyboard Shortcuts
With a presenter remote (good for standing at mic)

Shortcut | Action
--- | ---
Next (PgDn) | Record
Prev (PgUp) |  Stop, toggle between keep and discard

While another app has focus (good for demos)

Shortcut | Action
--- | ---
Ctrl+Shift+F10 | Record
Ctrl+Shift+F11 | Stop, toggle between keep and discard

The recording automatically trims 200 ms from the beginning and end of each clip to mask 
the sound of the keyboard or remote. Pause for half a beat before speaking. 

*Practice before using the tool in anger :)*
